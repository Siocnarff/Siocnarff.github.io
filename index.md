## Welcome fair traveller!



This is my profile. 
There is not much here yet, because I am busy actually building cool things that I can tell you all about here in the future.

### But who am I?

I am a South African Computer Scientist in the making. I rather like building large complex systems, as well as trying to grasp the meaning of life.

I am interrested in a wide range of things. A small sample would be: Good books, like Narina and The Lord of the Rings. History, philosophy and theology. In terms of technology I believe that writing beautiful systems and producing elegant code is a true artform.
