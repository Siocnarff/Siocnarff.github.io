## Welcome fair traveller!



This is my profile. 
There is not much here yet, because I am busy actually building cool things that I can tell you all about here in the future.

### But who am I?

I am a South African Computer Scientist in the making with a love for building large complex systems, as well as for trying to grasp the meaning of live, and lift well, in a good, honourable manner.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Siocnarff/Siocnarff.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
