## Welcome fair traveller!



This is my profile. 
There is not much here yet, because I am busy actually building cool things that I can tell you all about here in the future.

### But who am I?

I am a South African Computer Scientist in the making with a love for building large complex systems, as well as for trying to grasp the meaning of live, and lift well, in a good, honourable manner.
